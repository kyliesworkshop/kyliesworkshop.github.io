    <h1>The Journey So Far</h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">
      <h2>Humble beginnings</h2>
      <p>When I first started woodworking I only used a drill, circular saw and a sander. All these tools I borrowed from my dad while I still lived at home. This really allowed me to explore whether I enjoyed woodworking without the financial commitment. I was also working on projects like painting old furniture and concrete art (which wasn’t very fun or successful). </p>

      <h2>The start of something new</h2>
      <p>The first tool I ever purchased was the R3 Kreg Jig. I’d seen many people on YouTube show how easy it was to use and it was quite affordable. This allowed me to start making furniture like my coffee table and tv unit with simple pocket hole joinery. By the time I finished my first few woodworking projects I knew I was hooked. </p>

      <h2>Channel creation</h2>
      <p>During this time I was watching a lot of woodworking YouTube videos and they really inspired me to record what I was making. I originally made my videos to share with my family and friends and to document my progress for my own goals. I was going to make the projects anyway but all I had to do was set up a camera as well, so I thought why not? I recorded my first video on my phone and I can still remember when my first video got 50 views (crazy that I now have over 100,000 views!). It amazed me how it kept getting views as time went on and this encouraged me to continue to share what I do. </p>
      <p>When I moved out of my home, Kylie’s workshop was really made. Having an indoor space to store my tools and work really made it feel like a workshop.</p>

      <h2>Entering the power tool world</h2>
      <p>My first big tool purchase was my mitre saw. I purchased this as my circular saw wasn't giving me the accuracy I needed to improve my quality of work. I love my mitre saw. It’s large enough that I don't need a table saw for my projects. To be honest, table saws scare me with how dangerous they are so I know I wont be purchasing one any time soon (see Ultimate Workshop for more details).</p>

      <h2>Upgrading the basics</h2>
      <p>My next purchase for power tools was my drill and driver. I was using a second hand one (first from my dad and then one from my partner). However I found that it was beginning to get annoying and time consuming when the bits would fall out of the drill (as the chuck had lost its ability to lock) and the batteries would run out quite quickly. An upgrade to a new drill was a necessity rather than a desire to. I chose the Makita brand as they proved trustworthy with the mitre saw and I still feel that way. </p>

      <h2>Router and router lift</h2>
      <p>Finding a good router to work in a router table without spending a fortune was difficult to work out but when this product became available in Australia I new I’d made the right choice. I didn't have to buy a dedicated router table but I could still upgrade to one in the future. A dedicated router table would cost more and take up valuable workshop floor space. This router is powerful and so easy to use I know it will last me for many years to come. </p>

      <h2>Bits and bobs</h2>
      <p>Along the way I gained many small tools such as craving chisels, wood burner, clamps etc. Many of them feature in my videos. </p>
