			<h2>Picture Frame</h2>
			<h5>Simple classic custom</h5>
			<img src="./images/frame.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="frame">
			<p>My degree didnt come in a standard size and my university was going to charge hundreds to frame it. This simple frame was easy to make and doesnt cost hundreds.</p>

			<h2>Desk</h2>
			<h5>Lightweight smooth efficient</h5>
			<img src="./images/desk.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="desk">
			<p>This desk was custom build to the small space between a build in wardrobe and the wall. It was 20cm too small of a gap to buy a standard size desk. I was able to make a desk to fit the space perfectly and not over crowd the space. The notch at the back allows easy cable management without having to move the desk in and out.</p>

			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<img src="./images/logo.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="logo">
			<p>I started woodworking in 2016 with the desire to not spend money on poorly made self-assemble furniture and make it myself. I found out I had huge passion for making things with wood. I decided when I started to share my passion with others through YouTube. Thank you for taking the time to support me by coming to this site or watching my videos.</p>
